## PicoStreamer

PicoStreamer is a MICROSCOPIC* "YouTube Downloader", which connects to a video stream (because YouTube streams videos like Spotify), and then puts it into a file.

*the main script (found in the linux & mac source release) is only 860 bytes, and that is less than a thousandth of 1 MB (megabyte)!

#How to use:
1. [Download](https://github.com/CenTdemeern1/picostreamer/releases/tag/1.0), extract and run the program (give it some extra time on the first run)

2. When it asks for videos;
	1. give it a single YouTube video URL (YouTube video link)
	OR
	2. give it a list of YouTube links seperated by pipes (these things -> | , on most keyboards "SHIFT + \ "),
	OR
	3. copy-paste (Use right-click (and click paste if menu pops up); CTRL+V sometimes won't work!) a list seperated by "newlines" (the "character" you type when you press the "ENTER" key on the keyboard)

3. Press ENTER and watch the program automagically download your videos!
